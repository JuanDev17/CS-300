What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course? 

- Dealing with hashtables and other types of data models.


How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

- I approached the problem by prioritizing a scalable and efficient design. Selecting data structures that would optimize memory usage and data retrieval. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

- I used stackoverflow to research to get over a bunch of obstacles. Also utilize ZyBooks to get over some issues as well.  

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

- I learned a lot about data structures and algorithms from the projects. I also realize how important pseudocode is. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?


- I think my work on the project has forced me to write more unstandable and flexiable code.
